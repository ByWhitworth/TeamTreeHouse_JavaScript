# JavaScript Basics: Programming Multiple Outcomes
Adding more variety to your programs by using a `else if` statement. 

```
if () {
} else if () {

} else {

}
```

The code block at the very end won't be work unless if two statements are `false`

There is no limit in the `else if()` clauses you have in your `else if` statement.
