# Combining Strings
###Concatenation

The process of combining strings is called "concatenation". In JavaScript, you combine strings with a + operator like this:

```'one string ' + ' another string'```


If you have a variable that contains a string you can combine it with a literal string value to come up with a new string:

```
var name = "Dave";
var message = "Hello " + name;
```
