# Naming Variables 

JavaScript has a lot of reserved words (Keywords) that can't be used as a **variable**

[Mozilla Resreved Words Reference Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords)

Names can't start with a number
`9lives`
But can end with a number
`right1`


Names can only contain`Letters Numbers  $ _`

*Examples `priceper#` and `@home`* are _not_ allowed

###but

`price$` and `home_alone` are allowed

Another examples in how programmers write out variables:
`price_per_unit` or `pricePreUnit`

Capitalize after the first word is called "Camelcase"

####What you should use when you write variables.
Descriptive variables will help out in the long run. This will greatly help understanding your programs.
