# Your First JavaScript Program


```
alert("Hello from Treehouse);
```

What we wrote is called a statement.

```
alert("Hello from Treehouse");
document.write("<h1>Welcome to JavaScript Basics</h1>");
```

`document.write();` writes onto the document, which is your html file.

One statement write one after another.
