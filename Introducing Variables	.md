# Introducing Variables	


Variables is an useful way to store and track information from a program. 

Score is a good example for a variable. 

`var score=0;`
assigning a value to a variable. 
This statement is also called a 'string'.

```
var message = "Hello!";
alert(message);
```
*this will display "Hello" in a popup*

```
var message = "Hello!";
alert(message);
message = "Welcome to JavaScript Basics";
alert(message);
```
*you only need to state `var` once for that particular variable*
