# JavaScript Basics: Comparison Operators


| > | Greater Than |
| :-: | :-: |
| >= | Greater Than or Equal To |
| <Â  | Less Than |
| <= | Less Than or Equal to |
| == | Equal To |
| === | Strict Equal To |
| != | Not Equal to |
| !== | Strict Not Equal To |

The `==` operator can get you into some weird situtations. For example. 

`(''==0)` Is true
`(''===0)` Is False
