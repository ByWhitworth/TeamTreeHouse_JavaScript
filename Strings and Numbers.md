Two common value types are 
- Numbers

####Strings
Used for words, sentences, and other text.

*seen in the alert command*
`alert("This is a warning");`

The quote marks tells the javaScript interpreter to treat the values inside as a set of characters without any special meaning. 

*double or single quotation marks can be used. Just make sure you are consistent*   

`message = 'She's a great person!';` 
*this could cause the JavaScript interpreter to start and end at 'She' and will give you a syntax error.

#####likewise

`var htmlSnippet = '<h1 class="special">Important Headline</h1>';`

so basically make sure you use the corresponding quotation marks. 


####Escape Character
